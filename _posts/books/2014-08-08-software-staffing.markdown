According to Software Engenirring Economics (Boehm, 1981), five principles are:
---------------

1.  Top talent – use better and fewer people;
2.  Job matching – fit the tasks to the skills and motivation people available;
3.  Career progression – help people to self-actualize rather than forcing them to work where they have the most expierence or where they are most needed
4.  Team balance – select people who will comliment and garmonize with each other
5.  Misfit ellimination – eliminate and replace problem team members as quickly as possible

Process
-----
It's not about buorocracy, it's about all peaple know, what to do

Motivation
------
Motivated people gives more to the job, than unmotivated. Actually, de-motivated person could create more damage, even with no idea of damage on mind.
