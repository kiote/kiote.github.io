What "learn" means
------------------

By "learn" I mean I can easely and correctly use this words in sentences (with no using of translator).

Program of learning
-------------------

1. Using flashcards â€“ I want to create 28 paper flashcards with this words. With word on one side and a picture (not translation) on other side.
2. I want to find pictures with google images, for example hesitate: http://vecto.rs/1024/vector-of-a-cartoon-woman-hesitating-to-push-a-button-outlined-coloring-page-by-ron-leishman-18650.jpg
3. I want to draw all the pictures by myself (although I have really weak drawing skills)
4. Every week I'll learn 7 new words. 4 words per one day, with 6 repetitions during the week.
5. Every week except first I'll repeat all words from previous week every second day.
6. So program for first week: remember 7 words, repeat them every day, 6 days a week, one day rest;
   for second week: remember new 7 words, the same story as for first week, plus every second day repeat words from first week;
   for third week: new 7 words plus every second day repeat words from second week, every third day - from first week;
   for fourth week: new 7 words plus every fourth day -repeat words from first week, every third - words from second week, every second day - from third week.

So whole program should take 4 week + 2 days.
